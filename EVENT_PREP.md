# Event preparation

## Event dates
The #wd42 events are held on the last Wednesday of each month except December. 
Note: I don't know what we do if that day falls on a public holiday.

## Speakers
Speakers can be set for an event at any point. If they are set quite early it's worth confirming before the first event notifications are sent out.

## Event notifications
Event communication is currently done by EMail, Twitter, and Facebook.

### Two weeks out from event
**Social blast (Tweet + FB)**

Try to announce at least one speaker at this point. Use title for talk if you have it or just cover the topic.

### Week before the event
**Email mailout**

Before mailout need to:
 - Crete event in Tito
 - Update website

Hopefully should have both speakers lined-up at this point. Need to include Tito URL in email body in button.
Email body mostly stays the same except sometimes you need to make sure whether it's "this Wednesday" or "next Wednesday" in the copy.

## Early the week of the event
**Repeat socials**

Repeat the social posts. Generally two tweets a little apart (maybe 3, 6, or 12 hours). Facebook post can just be one.
These two posts need to include:
 - Venue details and times
 - That pizza + drinks are provided for free
 - Sponsor details
 
## Day of the event
Need to set up chairs and TV in venue. 
 
Currently the venue sponsor takes care of the drinks fridge being stocked. And the pizza is ordered on the night, so there isn't any prep currently.
