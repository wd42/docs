# Information for speakers

This document is information for anyone who is speaking at an upcoming #wd42 event

## Organising to speak
If you've spoken with the organisers about a potential talk they will also confirm with you an event where you can speak. If you have a preference for speaking first or second you can raise it, we can generally accomodate those requests.

## Leading up to the event
We do some mailouts and promotions in the lead up to the event. Any time you get a talk title ready you can let us know. These don't need to be set in stone, so don't stress.
Generally the first mailout is about 2 weeks out from the event. If we don't have a title at this point we'll probably just describe the talk based on what we know about your topic. Regardless of what is announced, nothing is set in stone for your talk.

## Talk tips
### Do's
- Make the talk broadly accessible (require as little prior knowledge as possible)
- Use slides to compliment your talk if appropriate
- Challenge ideas
- Keep it simple

### Don'ts
- Have too much content in slides
- Platform shame (that is, don't make comments or jokes which imply that a tool, technique, language, platform, etc. is inferior). 
- Talks must not be sexist, racist, obviously offensive, or attack individuals or groups
- Include or mention people (e.g. by name, image, etc.) without their permission unless they are a public figure for the reason you're discussing them

## On the night
### Equipment
Speakers generallly present from their own laptops. We have a TV with an HDMI input to display from. If you need to borrow a computer to present from that can be arranged with notice. We encourage speakers to try setting up early on the night (e.g. you can come in before the normal 5:30 start time).

### Talk length
We like talks to be 25 - 30 minutes long. That gives us 10 - 15 minutes for questions, chats, overrun, etc. If possible it's great to have a few practice runs for your talk to check timing.

## What if you need to pull out?
Life happens and things change. If at any stage you need to pull out just let us know as soon as you do.
